# SC1015 Mini Project
## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which studies the specifications of mobile phones to determine the price of mobile phones. For a detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

## Problem Statement

How do different mobile phone specifications affect its price?
Are we able to predict the price of phones by their specifications?

## Models Used

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest

## Conclusion

1. The RAM of a mobile phone is a key specification that influences the most mobile price among the 20 specifications we explored.

## What did we learn from this project?

1. Interpreting a multiclass confusion matrix
2. The use of different machine learning models to improve the performance
3. Technique to find the optimal hyperparameters for maximum accuracy
4. The causes and effects of overfitting
